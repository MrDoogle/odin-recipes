    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>There is something special about what yogurt does to chicken in its smoky, sizzling time over charcoal. It imparts a tangy flavor that lifts all the other flavorings. It tenderizes slightly, without turning the meat into mush. It grills to a caramelized dark brown without tasting burnt.</p>

    <h3>Ingedients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>½ cup plain low-fat Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>½ lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon herbes de Provence</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (5 pound) whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together the 1/2 cup yogurt, the juice from 1/2 lemon, lemon zest, olive oil, garlic, paprika, herbes de Provence, 1 teaspoon salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add chicken, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in refrigerator for at least 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Combine 1/2 cup yogurt, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and harissa in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from bag and transfer to a plate or baking sheet lined with paper towels. Pat chicken pieces dry with more paper towels. Season with pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Grill chicken, skin-side down, on the preheated grill for 2 minutes. Turn each piece and move to indirect heat.</li>
        <li>Grill, turning often, with lid down until well-browned and meat is no longer pink in the center, 30 to 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Serve chicken with the yogurt harissa mixture on the side.</li>
    </ol>
